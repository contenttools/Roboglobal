        <p>Statement regarding the IOSCO Principles for Financial Benchmarks</p>

        <strong>General</strong>
        <p>ROBO Global LLC (ROBO Global) is the benchmark administrator for the ROBO Global Robotics and Automation Index Series, as defined in the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) Principles for Financial Benchmarks.</p>
        <p>ROBO Global is aware of the risks posed by inadequate governance, conflicts of interest and a lack of transparency in the management of indices, and has built its controls processes for the ROBO Global indices with these in mind, and with input from external index experts.</p>

        <strong>Proportionality and Extent of Compliance</strong>
        <p>ROBO Global devised the Rules for the Management of the ROBO Global Robotics and Automation Index Series. They are managed by its index management committee, one member of which is an external index expert. The committee can additionally call on expertise from an external advisory group in the field of robotics and automation. Index reviews and the calculation of the index series are carried out by an external index calculation agent, currently Solactive AG.</p>
        <p>ROBO Global believes it is in broad compliance with the IOSCO Principles for Financial Benchmarks, given its understanding of the use of its indices and consideration of the nature of the investment products based upon them. It intends to further document, and if appropriate amend, its internal processes and governance in accordance with the requirements of Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 (commonly known as the “EU Benchmarks Regulation” or “BMR”), and intends to apply for registered benchmark administrator status under this regulation.</p>

          <p>The ROBO Global® Robotics and Automation Index and the ROBO Global® Robotics and Automation UCITS Index (the "Indices") are the property of ROBO who have contracted with Solactive AG to calculate and maintain the Indices. The Indices are not sponsored by Solactive AG or its affiliates. Neither Solactive AG, nor any of their affiliates will be liable for any errors or omissions in calculating the Indices. Closing prices for the Indices are calculated by Solactive AG based on the closing price of the individual constituents of the index as set by their primary exchange.

          <p>Past performance of an index is not a guarantee of future results. The value of investments may go down as well as up and potential investors may not get back the amount originally invested. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. Exposure to an asset class represented by an index is available through investable instruments based on that index. ROBO makes no assurance that investment products based on the index will accurately track index performance or provide positive investment returns. A decision to invest in any such investment fund or other investment vehicle should not be made in reliance on any of the statements set forth in this document. ROBO is not in a position to give advice on the suitability of any investments for potential investors. Prospective investors are advised to make an investment in any such fund or other vehicle only after carefully considering the risks associated with investing in such funds, as detailed in an offering memorandum or similar document that is prepared by or on behalf of the issuer of the investment fund or other vehicle. Inclusion of a security within an index is not a recommendation by ROBO to buy, sell, or hold such security, nor is it considered to be investment advice.</p>
          <p>It is not intended that anything stated in this factsheet should be construed as an offer or invitation to buy or sell any investment in any Investment Fund or other investment vehicle referred to in this website, or for potential investors to engage in any investment activity.</p>
          <p>No Investment Fund or other investment vehicle based on the Indices is sponsored, promoted, sold or supported in any other manner by ROBO or Solactive AG (the “Index Parties”) nor do the Index Parties offer any express or implicit guarantee or assurance either with regard to the results of using the Indices and/or an Index trademark or an Index price at any time or in any other respect. The Index Parties use their best efforts to ensure that the Indices are calculated correctly. Irrespective of their obligations towards the Company, the Index Parties have no obligation to point out errors in the Indices to third parties including but not limited to investors in, and/or financial intermediaries of, any Investment Funds or other investment vehicles. Neither publication of the Indices by Solactive AG nor the licensing of the Indices or an Index trademark by ROBO for the purpose of use in connection with any Investment Fund or other investment vehicle based on the Indices constitutes a recommendation by the Index Parties to invest capital in any such fund or investment vehicle nor does it in any way represent an assurance or opinion of the Index Parties with regard to any investment in such fund or investment vehicle.</p>
