        <div class="legal-top-line">ROBO Global LLC is collectively referred to as “ROBO Global.”</div>
        <p>Redistribution, reproduction and/or photocopying in whole or in part are prohibited without written permission. This document does not constitute an offer of services in jurisdictions where ROBO Global does not have the necessary licenses. All information provided by ROBO Global is impersonal and not tailored to the needs of any person, entity or group of persons.
        The ROBO Global® Robotics and Automation Index and the ROBO Global® Robotics and Automation UCITS Index (the “Indices”) are the property of ROBO Global who have contracted with Solactive AG to calculate and maintain the Indices. The Indices are not sponsored by Solactive AG or its affiliates. Neither Solactive AG, nor any of their affiliates will be liable for any errors or omissions in calculating the Indices. Closing prices for the Indices are calculated by Solactive AG based on the closing price of the individual constituents of the index as set by their primary exchange. Historical performance illustrations in the Indices are based on a backcast calculation. A backcast calculation can be materially different from a backtest analysis.</p>
        <p>Past performance of an index is not a guarantee of future results. The value of investments may go down as well as up and potential investors may not get back the amount originally invested. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. Exposure to an asset class represented by an index is available through investable instruments based on that index. ROBO Global makes no assurance that investment products based on the index will accurately track index performance or provide positive investment returns. A decision to invest in any such investment fund or other investment vehicle should not be made in reliance on any of the statements set forth in this document. ROBO Global is not in a position to give advice on the suitability of any investments for potential investors. Prospective investors are advised to make an investment in any such fund or other vehicle only after carefully considering the risks associated with investing in such funds, as detailed in an offering memorandum or similar document that is prepared by or on behalf of the issuer of the investment fund or other vehicle. Inclusion of a security within an index is not a recommendation by ROBO Global to buy, sell, or hold such security, nor is it considered to be investment advice.
        It is not intended that anything stated in this website should be construed as an offer or invitation to buy or sell any investment in any Investment Fund or other investment vehicle referred to in this website, or for potential investors to engage in any investment activity.</p>
        <p>No Investment Fund or other investment vehicle based on the Indices is sponsored, promoted, sold or supported in any other manner by ROBO Global or Solactive AG (the “Index Parties”) nor do the Index Parties offer any express or implicit guarantee or assurance either with regard to the results of using the Indices and/or an Index trademark or an Index price at any time or in any other respect. The Index Parties use their best efforts to ensure that the Indices are calculated correctly. Irrespective of their obligations towards the Company, the Index Parties have no obligation to point out errors in the Indices to third parties including but not limited to investors in, and/or financial intermediaries of, any Investment Funds or other investment vehicles. Neither publication of the Indices by Solactive AG nor the licensing of the Indices or an Index trademark by ROBO Global for the purpose of use in connection with any Investment Fund or other investment vehicle based on the Indices constitutes a recommendation by the Index Parties to invest capital in any such fund or investment vehicle nor does it in any way represent an assurance or opinion of the Index Parties with regard to any investment in such fund or investment vehicle</p>
