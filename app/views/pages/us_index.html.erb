          <div>
            <p>The goal of ROBO Global is to provide an accessible, intelligent, and diversified platform to track this next megatrend.  Our management team and strategic advisory board is comprised of senior leaders from both the academic and financial research world. This index is global, deliberately broad and  built for the long term. The best approach for an industry in its early stages is to be as inclusive as possible as there  will be tremendous creative destruction to come. Including all players in a proportionate and equally weighted fashion ensures that we capture the overall growth trend while minimizing company-specific risk.</p>

                  <p>In order for a system to exhibit autonomy, it must be able to sense its environment, in addition to determining its own internal state.  For human beings, these are called exteroception and proprioception.   Sensing is important for the same reasons that our exteroceptive senses (sight, sound, etc.), and our proprioceptive senses (ability to know where our limbs are and what they are doing without directly observing them) are important for human beings.  For robotic systems, however, we are not limited to the standard senses. Almost anything that can be measured can be made into a sensor.</p>

                  <p>Autonomous systems must make decisions at various levels ranging from basic motion control to determining the state of the environment they are operating in and optimally planning actions.  Part of this processing is not only making sense of the information received from sensors, but also planning actions in order to achieve a desired objective.</p>

                  <p>Actuation is the means by which machines interact with the physical world.  For human beings, this mainly refers to our limbs, and in particular, our hands. However, machines are not limited to manipulation.  Almost anything that has an effect on the physical world can be made into an actuator.  Actuation techniques include electric, hydraulic (compressed fluid), mechanical, and pneumatic (compressed air).</p>

                  <p>The path from sensing, to processing, to actuation, requires computation.  It is analogous to our brain, and is what allows the processing of information to produce actuation.  Computing can vary from embedded systems smaller than a fingernail to server-farms implementing sophisticated algorithms.</p>

        <div class="portfolio-des">
          <p>The Index is made up of “bellwether” (40%) and “non-bellwether” (60%) companies. Bellwether companies (BWs) are well established leading players, whose core business is directly related to robotics & automation. Non-bellwether companies (NBWs) have a distinct portion of their business and revenue in robotics & automation and have the potential to grow through innovation and/or market adoption of their products and/or services. Within BW and NBW each constituent is equally weighted. This approach avoids the large capitalisation and “buy high, sell low” biases of market capitalization indices and ensures that the Index provides exposure to companies in the early stages of new innovation and technologies as well as the more established players. The 40/60 weighting results in each BW having roughly twice the weight of each NBW. Index constituents are initially selected from the ROBO Global Classification in accordance with predetermined rules and objective criteria including minimum market capitalization and average daily value traded. At each quarterly rebalance the Index constituents are reweighted and any additions or deletions are made as determined by the Advisory Index Committee at ROBO Global®.</p>
