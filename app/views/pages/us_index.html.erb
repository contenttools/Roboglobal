          <div>
            <p>The goal of ROBO Global is to provide an accessible, intelligent, and diversified platform to track this next megatrend.  Our management team and strategic advisory board is comprised of senior leaders from both the academic and financial research world. This index is global, deliberately broad and  built for the long term. The best approach for an industry in its early stages is to be as inclusive as possible as there  will be tremendous creative destruction to come. Including all players in a proportionate and equally weighted fashion ensures that we capture the overall growth trend while minimizing company-specific risk.</p>

                  <p>In order for a system to exhibit autonomy, it must be able to sense its environment, in addition to determining its own internal state.  For human beings, these are called exteroception and proprioception.   Sensing is important for the same reasons that our exteroceptive senses (sight, sound, etc.), and our proprioceptive senses (ability to know where our limbs are and what they are doing without directly observing them) are important for human beings.  For robotic systems, however, we are not limited to the standard senses. Almost anything that can be measured can be made into a sensor.</p>

                  <p>Actuation is the means by which machines interact with the physical world.  For human beings, this mainly refers to our limbs, and in particular, our hands. However, machines are not limited to manipulation.  Almost anything that has an effect on the physical world can be made into an actuator.  Actuation techniques include electric, hydraulic (compressed fluid), mechanical, and pneumatic (compressed air).</p>

                  <p>Autonomous systems must make decisions at various levels, from determining the state of the environment they are operating in, to optimally planning actions and controlling motion. It is analogous to our brain, and is what allows the processing of information to produce actuation to take place. This requires raw computing and processing power as well as increasingly advanced software. Computing can vary from embedded systems smaller than a fingernail to hyper-scale data centers implementing sophisticated algorithms including Artificial Intelligence (AI). Machines are getting smarter as improvements in data storage and processing power have enabled the emergence of AI across a rapidly expanding range of applications. Advancements in AI, especially machine learning, are key to the growth of autonomous systems. AI also encompasses perception, such as machine vision and natural language processing.</p>

A new generation of autonomous systems, sensors and data analytics tools are bringing tremendous benefits, not only to farmers and breeders in terms of increased yields and lower costs, but also to the environment in terms of improved water, pesticides and fertilizer use. Meanwhile, the food processing industry continues to automate aggressively to meet increasingly demanding volume, cost and safety requirements. Emerging markets offer significant penetration upside for traditional automation equipment from dairy and beverage to bakery and meat processing to packaging. In the more mature food markets, robotics and automation helps companies develop a more agile response to changing customer tastes and increasingly stringent safety requirements.</p>

        <div class="portfolio-des">
          <p>The Index is made up of “bellwether” (40%) and “non-bellwether” (60%) companies. Bellwether companies (BWs) are well established leading players, whose core business is directly related to robotics & automation. Non-bellwether companies (NBWs) have a distinct portion of their business and revenue in robotics & automation and have the potential to grow through innovation and/or market adoption of their products and/or services. Within BW and NBW each constituent is equally weighted. This approach avoids the large capitalisation and “buy high, sell low” biases of market capitalization indices and ensures that the Index provides exposure to companies in the early stages of new innovation and technologies as well as the more established players. The 40/60 weighting results in each BW having roughly twice the weight of each NBW. Index constituents are initially selected from the ROBO Global Classification in accordance with predetermined rules and objective criteria including minimum market capitalization and average daily value traded. At each quarterly rebalance the Index constituents are reweighted and any additions or deletions are made as determined by the Advisory Index Committee at ROBO Global&trade;.</p>
